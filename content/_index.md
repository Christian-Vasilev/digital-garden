ðŸ‘‹  **W**elcome to my first attempt at creating a ðŸŒ± digital garden. 

My name is [Ivanka](https://itodorova.dev) and I am currently studying **Computer Science** at [New Bulgarian University](https://nbu.bg/).

As of now, this place is entirely consiting of computer science-y things, but my interests go beyond that topic. 

A short ToC of mathematic topics I took notes in my first year of study can be found below.

## Discrete Mathematics
