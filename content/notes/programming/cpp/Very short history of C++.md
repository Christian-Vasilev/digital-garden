The **C** language was created and developed alongside the UNIX OS
	- First version is created by Dennis Ritchie in 1973
	- In 1977 UNIX was rewritten in **C**
	- It was initially designed for developing operating systems, but other applications were soon found
- American National Standards Institute, *ANSI*,  formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of **C** in 1983
- The prerelase Standard **C** was published in 1988, sometimes referred to as *C88*
- Bjarne Stroustrup develops **C++** in 1983 at Bell Labs as an extension to **C**. **C++** is based on **C**, but it also features:
	- virtual functions
	- references
	- constants
	- inheritence
	- overloading
	- templates
	- exceptions
	- type-safe free-store memory allocation (`new`/`delete`)
	- improved type checking
- Main difference between **C** and **C++** is that **C** is function-driven procedural language with no support for object and classes, whereas **C++** is a combination of procedural and object-oriented programming language.
- Most programs written in **C** can be compiled with **C++** compiler with little to no changes
- **C++** offers:
	- low level of abstraction 
	- more control over the hardware
	- direct memory access
	- easy to run on multiple platforms
- **C++** is not suitable for writing web applications
