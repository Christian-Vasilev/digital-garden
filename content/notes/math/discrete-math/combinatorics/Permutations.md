A permutation is a mathematical technique that determines the number of possible arrangements in a set **when the order
of the arrangements matters**.

With repetition:

$$ P = n^r $$

Without repetition, using all elements:
$$ P = n!
$$ $n!$ is the notation of n [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Factorial|factorial]].

Without repetition, using *some* ($r$) elements:

$$ P(n, r) = n! \cdot (n-r)! = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} $$
