A [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] $G = (V, E)$ is an **Eulerian Graph** if it contains a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Euler Circuit]].

A [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] $G$ is **Eulerian Graph** iff the [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]] of each [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertex]] is an even number.
