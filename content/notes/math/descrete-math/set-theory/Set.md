## Definition
> A *set* is an unordered collection of objects, called *elements* or *members* of the set.

## Representation

To represent if something belongs or not to a set, we can say the following:
> $1 \in A$  - This means that 1 **IS IN** A

>$-1 \notin A$ - This means tha -1 **IS NOT** IN A

## Examples
Example of a set is:
* The Capital letter at the start is used to name the **SET**.
* All the elements in the set are separated by comma.

> $$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\dots\}$$

* The ellipsis (...) is used to:
	* To indicate that the set has no limit (when used in the end of a set).

> $$A = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, {99\}}$$

Same as above, but

* The ellipsis (...) is used to:
	* Define a finite set (when used in the middle).
