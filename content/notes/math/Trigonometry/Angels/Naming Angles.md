## Measure Angles
> We measure angles in **Degrees** or and **Radiants**. One full circle is equal to 360° or 2π. We can imagine that the value of π is equal to 180°


If we want to express the sum of **Angel 1** and **Angle 2**, we can say that:

* M < 1 + M < 2 = 360°
* M < 1 + M < 2 = 2π

## Different type of angles
There are 5 different type of angles:
* **The 0 degree Angle**
	* If the starting side of the angle and the ending side of the engle are aligned on top of each other. Then we call this the 0 degree angle.

* **Acute Angle**
	* If we open up the Rays a little bit (< 90°) we end up with the Acute angle. It is less than a full quater circle

* **Right Angle**
	* The Right Angle is when we have exactly a full quater circle.

* **Obtuse**
	* This is when we have something greather than a quater circle but less than a full half circle or less than e semi curcle

* **Straight**
	* When we get to a full half circle or a semi circle we call it a Straight Angle.

*  **360 Angle**
	* A full circle is always 360°.

## Table Of Degrees And Radiants


| Angle in Radiants | Angle in degree |  Angle Name |
| ----------------- | ----------------| ----------- |
| **α** = 0 | θ = 0° | 0 or zero Degree/Radiant Angle |
| 0 < **α** < π/2 | 0° < **α** < 90° | Acute Angle |
| **α** = π/2| θ = 90° | Right Angle |
| π/2 < **α** < π | 90 < **α** < 180° | Obtuse Angle |
| **α** = π | **α** = 180° | Straight Angle |
| **α** = 2π | **α** = 360° | 360° or completed angle |
