## Independence

- Any $2$ two-dimensional linearly independent vectors will span $\mathbb{R}^2$. The two-dimensional [[notes/math/linear-algebra/Basis vectors|basis vectors]] $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ are linearly independent, which is why they span $\mathbb{R}^2$.
- Any $2$ two-dimensional linearly independent vectors will span $\mathbb{R}^3$. The two-dimensional basis vectors $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$ and $\hat{k}$ are linearly independent, which is why they span $\mathbb{R}^3$.
- Any $n$ $n$-dimensional linearly independent vectors will span $\mathbb{R}^n$. The $n$-dimensional basis vectors are linearly independent, which is why they span $\mathbb{R}^n$.

## Dependence

- When $2$ two-dimensional vectors lie along the same line (or along parallel lines), they're called **collinear**, they're linearly dependent, and they won't span $\mathbb{R}^2$.
- When $3$ two-dimensional vectors lie along the same plane, they're called **coplanar**, they're linearly dependent, and they won't span $\mathbb{R}^3$.
- When $n$ $n$-dimensional vectors lie along the same $(n - 1)$-dimensional space, they're linearly dependent, and they won't span $\mathbb{R}^n$.
