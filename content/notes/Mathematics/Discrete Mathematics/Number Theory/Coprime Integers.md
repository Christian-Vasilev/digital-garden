Two integers a and b are **coprime**, *relatively prime* or *mutually prime*, if the only positive integer that is a divisor of both of them is $1$. In other words if $a$ and $b$ are integers and they are coprimes if and only if [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Number Theory/gcd]]$(a, b) = 1$.
