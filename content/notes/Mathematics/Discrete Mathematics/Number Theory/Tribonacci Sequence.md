**Tribonacci Sequence** is a generalization of the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Number Theory/Fibonacci Sequence]] where each term is the sum of the **three** preceeding items.

$$
\begin{align}
& F_0 = 0, \quad F_1 = 1 && \\
& F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} + F_{n-3}&& \\
&0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149,...&&

\end{align}
