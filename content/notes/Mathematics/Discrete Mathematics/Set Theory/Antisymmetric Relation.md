If $\rho \in A \times A$ ( $\rho$ is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Relation|relation]]):

$\rho$ is antisymmetric if for every $x$ and $y \in A$ from $x \: \rho \: y$ and $y \: \rho \: x \implies x = y$.

Antisymmetric relation is:
- "less or equal to" in the real number sets
