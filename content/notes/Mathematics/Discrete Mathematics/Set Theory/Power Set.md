Power [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Set|set]] of $A$, $P(A)$, is the set of all [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Subset|subsets]] of $A$.
$$B=\{0,1\}, P(B) = \{\varnothing,\{0\},\{1\},\{0,1\}\}$$

The number of subsets in a set is $2^n$, $n$ = number of elements.
