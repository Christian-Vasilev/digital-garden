We say that [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Set|sets]] $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if $A \subset B$ Ð¸ $B \subset A$.

$$
A= \{1,2,3\} \text{, } B = \{1, 1, 2,3\} \text{, } A = B
$$

Set equality is also a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Relation]] between two sets.
