If $\rho \in A \times A$ ( $\rho$ is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Relation|relation]]):

$\rho$ is symmetric, if for every $x$ and $y \in A$  from $x \: \rho \: y$ follows $y \: \rho \: x$.

Symmetric relation is:
- "equals to" in sets
- "equals to" in real numbers
- $\perp$ in a plane
