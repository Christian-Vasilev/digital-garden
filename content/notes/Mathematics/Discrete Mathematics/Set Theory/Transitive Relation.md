If $\rho \in A \times A$ ( $\rho$ is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Relation|relation]]):

$\rho$ is a transitive relation if for each $x$, $y$ and $z \in A$ from $x \: \rho \: y$ and $x \: \rho \: y \implies x \: \rho \: z$.

Transitive relations are:
- "greater than" in the set of real numbers
- "is subset of" in set theory
- "equality" in the set of real numbers
