An injective [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Function|function]] (also known as *injection*, *one-to-one function*, *инекция*, *еднозначна*) is a functon $f$ that maps distinct elements of its [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Function Domain|domain]] to distinct elements; that is, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)) \implies x_1 = x_2$.

In other words, every element of the function's [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Function Codomain|codomain]] is the image of **at most** one element of its domain.
