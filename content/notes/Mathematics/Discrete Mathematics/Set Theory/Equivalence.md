Sets with the same [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Set Cardinality|cardinal number]]  $$A = \{1,2,3\}, B = \{5,6,7\}, A \sim B$$.

Two [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Infinite Set|infinite sets]]  can also be equivalent: The set of all real numbers in $[0; 1]$ is equivalent to the set of all real numbers in $[0; 2]$.

Two sets are equivalent if there's a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Bijective Function|bijection]] between them.
