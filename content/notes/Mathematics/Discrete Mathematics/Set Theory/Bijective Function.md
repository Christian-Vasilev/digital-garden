When a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Function|function]] $f$ is both [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Bijective Function|bijective]] and [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Surjective Function|surjective]], it's called **bijective** (биекция).

Bijective function is a function between the elements of two [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Set|sets]], where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set.
