If [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Function|function]] $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Bijective Function|bijection]], then for each $a \in A$ there's only one $b \in B$ (and the counter for each $b \in B$ there's only one $a in A$), the function $f^-1: B \rightarrow A$ is called **inverse function** and it's defined by $f^-1(b) = a$.
