Relation is a connection between two [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Set|sets]]. [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Equality]] of sets is a relation. Also, relation between only two sets is called *binary*.

$\in\text{, }\notin\text{, }>\text{, }<\text{, }\leq\text{, }\geq$ are also binary relations. 

$\perp\text{, }\not\perp\text{, }\triangleq$ are also binary relations.

Two relations are equal if and only if they are have the same [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Ordered Pairs|ordered pairs]].
