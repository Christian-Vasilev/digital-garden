The difference between [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Set|set]] $A$ and $B$ is a set that contains all elements of $A$, but no elements of $B$.


$$A \textbackslash B = \{x | x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}$$

The difference between a set $A$ and the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Universal Set]] is called the absolute [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Complement|complement]].

The difference between sets $A$ and $B$ is also an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Intersection|intersection]] of $A$ and the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Complement|complement]] of $B$ ($\overline{B}$).

$$A - B = A \cap \overline{B}$$
