A permutation isÂ a mathematical technique that determines the number of possible arrangements in a set **when the order of the arrangements matters**.

With repetition:

$$
P = n^r
$$

Without repetition, using all elements:
$$
P = n!
$$
$n!$ is the notation of n [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Number Theory/Factorial|factorial]].


Without repetition, using *some* ($r$) elements:

$$
P(n, r) = n! \cdot (n-r)! = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} 
$$
