## The Product rule

Suppose that a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. If there are $n_1$ ways to do the first task and for each of these ways of doing the first task, there are $n_2$ ways to do the second task, then there are $n_1 \cdot n_2$ ways to do the procedure.

## The Sum Rule

If a task can be done either in one of $n_1$ ways or in one of $n_2$ ways, where none of the set of $n_1$ ways is the same as any of the set of $n_2$ ways, then there are $n_1+n_2$ ways to do the task.

## The Subtraction Rule / Principle of inclusionâ€“exclusion

If a task can be done in either $n_1$ ways or $n_2$ ways, then the number of ways to do the task is $n_1$ + $n_2$ minus the number of ways to do the task that are common to the two different ways.

## The Division Rule

There are $\frac{n}{d}$ ways to do a task if it can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in $n$ ways, and for every way $w$, exactly $d$ of the $n$ ways correspond to way $w$.

## The Pigeonhole Principle

If $k$ is a positive integer and $k + 1$ or more objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more of the objects.


## The Generalized Pigeonhole Principle

If $N$ objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least $\lceil 
\frac{N}{k} \rceil$ objects.
