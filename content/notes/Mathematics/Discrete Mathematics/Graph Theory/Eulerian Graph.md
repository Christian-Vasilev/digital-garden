A [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] $G = (V, E)$ is an **Eulerian Graph** if it contains a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Euler Circuit]].

A [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] $G$ is **Eulerian Graph** iff the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]] of each [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertex]] is an even number.
