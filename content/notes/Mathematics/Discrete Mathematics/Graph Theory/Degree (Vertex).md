The **degree** of a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertex]] is the number of [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edge]] with that vertex as an endpoint and is denoted by $deg(x)$ or $d(x)$.

A vertex with $d(x) = 1$ is called an "end vertex".

A vertex with $d(x) = 0$ is called an "isolated vertex".
