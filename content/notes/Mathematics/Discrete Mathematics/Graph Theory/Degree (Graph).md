The total degree of a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] is the sum of the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]]  of its [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]]. The number can be found using the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Handshaking lemma]].

The [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Handshaking lemma]] also implies that
- the total degree of a graph is always an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Number Theory/Parity#^2338e6|even]] number 
- there are an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Number Theory/Parity#^2338e6|even]] number of [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] of odd degree
