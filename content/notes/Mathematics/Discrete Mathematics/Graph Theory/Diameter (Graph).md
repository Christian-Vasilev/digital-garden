The **diameter** of [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ is the maximum [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Eccentricity (Vertex)|eccentricity]] of any [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertex]] in $G$.

The diameter of a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Disconnected Graph|disconnected graph]] equals $+\infty$.
