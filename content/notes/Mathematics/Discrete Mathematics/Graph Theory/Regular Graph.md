A **regular graph** is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] where each vertex has the same number of neighbors; i.e. every vertex has the same [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]].

Regular graphs with vertices of degree $k$ are called $k$-regular graph or regular graph of degree $k$. Also, from the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Handshaking lemma|handshaking lemma]], a regular graph contains an even number of vertices with odd degree.
