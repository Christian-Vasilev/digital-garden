A **separating set** of a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Set|set]] of [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] whose deletion [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Disconnected Graph|disconnects]] $G$. A graph can have multiple **separating sets**.
