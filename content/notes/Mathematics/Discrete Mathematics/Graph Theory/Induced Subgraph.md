An **induced [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Subgraph|subgraph]]** of a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] is another graph, formed from a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Subset|subset]] of the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] of the graph and **all** of the edges (from the original graph) connecting pairs of vertices in that subset.

Every graph is an induced subgraph of itself.
