An **Euler Trail** is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Trail (Graph)|trail]] that visits every [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edge]] exactly once.

A **Euler Trail** exists in a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] iff there are only two [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] of odd [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]].

If a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] has more than 2 [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] of odd [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]] then it has **no Eulerian trail**.
