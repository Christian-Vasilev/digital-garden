A [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ is **connected** if and only if there is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Walk (Graph)|walk]] between each pair of [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]].

The opposite of a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Disconnected Graph]].
