A [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Directed Graph|directed graph]] formed by giving an orientation to every [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edge]] $ab$ in an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Undirected Graph|undirected graph]], such that it has at most one of the edges $\overrightarrow{ab}$ or $\overrightarrow{ba}$.

Oriented graphs have no [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Cycle (Graph)|2-cycles]].
