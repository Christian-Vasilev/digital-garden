A [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertex]] is **incident** with an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edge]] if the vertex is one of the two vertices the edge connects. 

An incidence is a pair $(u, e)$ where $u$ is a vertex and $e$ is an edge incident with $u$.
