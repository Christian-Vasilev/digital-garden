For a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertex]] in a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Directed Graph|directed graph]], the number of tail ends [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Adjacency (Graph)|adjacent]] to a vertex is called the **outdegree**, denoted by $d^-(x)$.
