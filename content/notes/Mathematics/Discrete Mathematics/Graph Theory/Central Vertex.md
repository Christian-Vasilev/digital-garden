If the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Eccentricity (Vertex)|eccentricity]] of a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertex]] $v$ in [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ equals the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Radius (Graph)|radius]] of $G$, then the $v$ is a **central vertex** of $G$.
