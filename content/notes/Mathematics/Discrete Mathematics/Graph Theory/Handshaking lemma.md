/a.k.a. the Degree Sum Formula/


$$
\sum_{x \in V}{d(x)} = 2 |E|
$$
This formula implies that in any [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Undirected Graph|undirected graph]], the number of vertices with odd [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]] is even.

$$
\sum_{x \in V}{d^+(x)}= \sum_{x \in V}{d^-(x)}
$$
