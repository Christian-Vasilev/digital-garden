A **complete graph** is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Undirected Graph|undirected graph]] in which every pair of distinct [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] is connected by an unique [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edge]].

A **complete graph** is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Directed Graph|directed graph]] in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a pair of unique edges (on in each direction).

Complete graph can also be described as a graph in which every two vertices are neighbouring.

Complete Graph with $n$ number of vertices is denoted by $K_n$.

The number of edges in a complete graph can be found using binomial coefficients:

$$
\binom{n}{2}
$$
