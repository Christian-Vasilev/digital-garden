For a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertex]] in a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Directed Graph|directed graph]] the number of head ends [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Adjacency (Graph)|adjacent]] to a vertex is called the **indegree**, denoted by $d^+(x)$.
