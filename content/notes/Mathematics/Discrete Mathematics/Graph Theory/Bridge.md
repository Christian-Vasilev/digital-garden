*мост, cut-edge, cut-arc*

**Bridge** is an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edge]] of a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] whose deletion increases the graph's number of connected [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Components|components]].

Equivalently, an edge is a **bridge** if and only if it is not contained in any [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Cycle (Graph)|cycle]].
