An **Euler Circuit** is an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Euler Trail|Euler Trail]] that visits every [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edge]] exactly once and starts and ends at the same [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertex]].

A **Euler Circuit** exists in a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] iff every [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertex]] has an even [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]].
