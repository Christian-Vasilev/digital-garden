**Graph theory** is the study of [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graphs]], which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] (also called nodes or points) which are connected by [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edges]] (also called links or lines).
