The vertex connectivity is the smallest number of [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] whose deletion causes a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] to be [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Disconnected Graph|disconnected]], denoted by $K(G)$.
