An **edge** is (together with [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]]) one of the two basic units out of which [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graphs]] are constructed. Each **edge** has two (or in [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Hypergraph|hypergraphs]], more) vertices to which it is attached, called its [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Endpoint|endpoints]]. 

**Edges** may be:
- undirected edges (also called lines)
- directed edges (also called arcs or arrows)

In an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Undirected Graph|undirected simple graph]], an edge may be represented as the set of its vertices, and in a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Directed Graph| directed simple graph]] it may be represented as an ordered pair of its vertices. 

An **edge** that connects vertices $x$ and $y$ is sometimes written $xy$.
