If $G$ is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] with $n$ [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]]:

-----

> $G$ is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] with no [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Cycle (Graph)|cycles]] (acyclic)

--------

> $G$ is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] with $n - 1$ [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edges]]

-------

> $G$ is [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Acyclic Graph|acyclic]] [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]] with $n - 1$ [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edges]].

------

> $G$ is [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Connected Graph|connected]], but removing an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edge]] [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Disconnected Graph|disconnects]] $G$

--------

> $G$ is [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Acyclic Graph|acyclic]] [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graph|graph]], but adding an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Edge|edge]] that connects any two not incident [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] makes $G$ cyclic.

---------

> For all pairs of [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] $x, y$ exists only one [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Path (Graphs)|path]]  in $G$ with [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Endpoint|endpoints]] $x$ and $y$.
