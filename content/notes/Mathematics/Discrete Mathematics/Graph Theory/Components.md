A **component** of an [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Undirected Graph|undirected graph]] is a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Connected Graph|connected]] [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Subgraph|subgraph]] that is not part of any larger connected subgraph.

The components of any graph partition its [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Vertex|vertices]] into [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Disjoint sets|disjoint sets]], and are the [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Graph Theory/Induced Subgraph|induced subgraphs]] of those sets.
